I am a research technologist in [Xu Lab](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjH3YHT-NT7AhWRFlkFHYZ1AxEQFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedawsonlab.org%2Fxu-lab&usg=AOvVaw3F6lBSVAg4-9sYeryqWfr5) at Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I did my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University as well. I double majored in Biological Sciences and Global Health during my undergraduate at Arizona State University. My current research interests include development and stem cell biology, translational and regenerative medicine, neurodegenerative diseases, and cellular engineering.
<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
